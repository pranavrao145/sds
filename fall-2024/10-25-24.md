This Week's Task (Audible Gasp)
===

<!--pause-->
- Add an option so instructor can preserve grading data when
  recollecting an already collected submission 
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Do this by `copying over` old grading data

<!-- end_slide -->

Recap: Last Week
===
- Finished writing tests for the new functionality
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
  - There were a lot of them
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Was having problems with one test being flaky (sometimes passing sometimes
  failing)
<!-- end_slide -->

Flaky Test Recap
===

# The Code We're Testing
<!-- pause -->
```ruby {1-22|4|10|13|15|16|17|19}
# assume a new_result has been created and an old_result exists

result_data = [
  { old: old_result.annotations, new: new_result.annotations },
  { old: old_result.marks, new: new_result.marks },
  { old: old_result.extra_marks, new: new_result.extra_marks }
]

# copy over data from old result to new result
result_data.each do |result_set|
  # get rid of the existing empty records so we can replace them; some results
  # have default models created, so this is necessary
  result_set[:new].destroy_all

  result_set[:old].each do |record|
    record_dup = record.dup
    record_dup.update(result_id: new_result.id)

    add_warning_messages(record_dup.errors.full_messages) if record_dup.errors.present?
  end
end
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Flaky Test Recap
===

# Sample Tests
<!-- pause -->
```ruby {1-14|3|4-5|11}
context 'for marks' do
    it 'creates the correct number of new marks for each result' do
      @new_results.zip(@original_results).each do |new_result, old_result|
        expect(new_result.marks.size).to eq(old_result.marks.size)
        expect(new_result.marks.ids).not_to eq(old_result.marks.ids)
      end
    end

    it 'retains the correct mark values for each result' do
      @new_results.zip(@original_results).each do |new_result, old_result|
        expect(new_result.marks.map(&:mark)).to eq(old_result.marks.map(&:mark))
      end
    end
end
```

<!-- pause -->
- 10% of the time: wrong order
<!-- pause -->
  - Expected: `[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]`
<!-- pause -->
  - Actual: `[0.0, 1.0, 1.0]`
<!-- pause -->
  - At this point, thought it could be `order by` clause returning things
    in the wrong order due to create time

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- 1% of the time: wrong numbers
<!-- pause -->
  - Expected: `[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]`
<!-- pause -->
  - Actual: `[0.0, 1.0, 1.0]`
<!-- pause -->
  - Maybe a caching issue with `let` vs `let!`
<!-- pause -->
  - Really hard to reproduce

<!-- end_slide -->
The Process
===
<!-- pause -->
- I (ChatGPT) wrote this script to run the failing tests several times to
  see if I could reproduce both errors consistently
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..100}
do
  echo "Running test iteration $i..."
  result=$(rspec ./spec/jobs/submissions_job_spec.rb:307 --format documentation 2>&1)

  if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo "Test iteration $i failed"
    echo "$result" | grep -E "expected:|actual:" -A 1
  else
    echo "Test iteration $i passed"
  fi
done
```
<!-- pause -->
- Was able to reproduce
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Also tried 20-30 times on the UI, but couldn't reproduce there 
<!-- pause -->
  - So it was a problem with the tests

<!-- end_slide -->
The Fix
===
# What Went Wrong
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Gave up; asked David what he thought in case I was missing something obvious
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- David pointed there are not just one but `two levels` of ordering that
  could go wrong
<!-- pause -->
```ruby {1-18|15|2-3,7-8|14}
before do
  @original_submissions = assignment.reload.current_submissions_used.to_a
  @original_results = assignment.current_results.to_a

  SubmissionsJob.perform_now(assignment.groupings, retain_existing_grading: true)

  @new_submissions = assignment.reload.current_submissions_used
  @new_results = assignment.reload.current_results
end

context 'for marks' do
    ...
    it 'retains the correct mark values for each result' do
      @new_results.zip(@original_results).each do |new_result, old_result|
        expect(new_result.marks.map(&:mark)).to eq(old_result.marks.map(&:mark))
      end
end
```

<!-- end_slide -->

The Fix
===
# The Actual Fix
- David suggested ordering things by fields common to the new and old results
<!-- pause -->
- Submissions and Results (`grouping_id`):
<!-- pause -->

```ruby
@original_submissions = assignment.reload.current_submissions_used
                                         .order('submissions.grouping_id')
                                         .to_a
@original_results = assignment.current_results.order('submissions.grouping_id')
                                              .to_a

@new_submissions = assignment.reload.current_submissions_used
                                    .order('submissions.grouping_id')
@new_results = assignment.reload.current_results
                                .order('submissions.grouping_id')
```

<!-- pause -->
- Marks (`criterion_id`)

<!-- pause -->
```ruby
expect(new_result.marks.order(:criterion_id).map(&:mark)).to eq(old_result
  .marks.order(:criterion_id).map(&:mark))
```

<!-- end_slide -->
Wrap Up and Next Week
===
<!-- pause -->
- Tests passed!
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Made PR and change to `Wiki`
<!-- pause -->
# Next Task
<!-- pause -->
- On lower resolution screens (1080P), assignment cannot be viewed
properly in the graders view, making it hard do annotations
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Issue 5178: Feature request: `Zoom in / out functionality` in pdf reader for graders #5178
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- David's notes:
<!-- pause -->
  - We're using the `pdf.js` library to render PDFs, which comes with this zoom functionality
<!-- pause -->
  - The zoom functionality is disabled because it was hard to integrate with the current React setup
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Implementation options:
<!-- pause -->
  - Ideally, figure out how to implement this library's features with the current setup
<!-- pause -->
  - Otherwise, implement custom zooming (which is what we do for images)
