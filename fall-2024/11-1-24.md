This Week's Tasks
===
# Task 1

<!--pause-->
- Add an option so instructor can preserve grading data when
  recollecting an already collected submission 
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Do this by `copying over` old grading data

<!-- pause -->
# Task 2
<!-- pause -->
- Incorporate `zoom functionality` for PDF viewer

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===
<!-- pause -->
# Summary
<!-- pause -->
- Got code review for backend
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Got rid of large copy loop
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Redid function organization
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Rewrote tests to go with it
<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===
# Large Loop Refactor

```ruby {1-22|4-6,10}
# assume a new_result has been created and an old_result exists

result_data = [
  { old: old_result.annotations, new: new_result.annotations },
  { old: old_result.marks, new: new_result.marks },
  { old: old_result.extra_marks, new: new_result.extra_marks }
]

# copy over data from old result to new result
result_data.each do |result_set|
  # get rid of the existing empty records so we can replace them; some results
  # have default models created, so this is necessary
  result_set[:new].destroy_all

  result_set[:old].each do |record|
    record_dup = record.dup
    record_dup.update(result_id: new_result.id)

    add_warning_messages(record_dup.errors.full_messages) if record_dup.errors.present?
  end
end
```
<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap

## David's Suggestions (Paraphrased)
<!-- pause -->
```
Overall, there are enough differences in behaviour that I don't 
think this loop is worth it.

Only existing marks need to be destroyed.

Only annotations need to have a separate check for an existing 
submission file.

For extra marks, you should copy over all point-based marks, 
but ignore all percentage-based marks. 
```
<!-- pause -->
## Lesson Learned
<!-- pause -->
- Don't optimize before you have to
<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===

<!-- pause -->
# Revamping Function Structure
<!-- pause -->

## The Old Code
```ruby +line_numbers {1-18|1|2-4,6-8|10-18|11|12|13|14-16}
class SubmissionsJob < ApplicationJob
  def add_warning_message(error)
    ...
  end

  def copy_grading_data(grouping)
    ...
  end

  def perform(groupings, retain_existing_grading: true)
    if retain_existing_grading
      groupings.each do |grouping|
        copy_old_grading_data(grouping)
        if errors
          add_warning_message(errors)
        end
      end
    end
  end
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===
<!-- pause -->
## David's Suggestions
<!-- pause -->
- Better to have the copy function be an `instance method` that takes another
  `submission` rather than a `grouping`
<!-- pause -->

### Old Setup
```ruby +line_numbers {1-9|2,6}
class SubmissionsJob < ApplicationJob
  def copy_grading_data(grouping) ... end

  def perform(groupings)
    groupings.each do |grouping|
      copy_old_grading_data(grouping)
    end
  end
end
```

<!-- pause -->

### New And Improved

```ruby +line_numbers {1-5|1}
class Submission < ApplicationRecord
  def self.copy_grading_data(old_submission)
    ...
  end
end
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===

### New And Improved

```ruby +line_numbers
class Submission < ApplicationRecord
  def self.copy_grading_data(old_submission)
    ...
  end
end
```

<!-- pause -->
### Implication 
<!-- pause -->
```ruby {1-9|4-6}
class SubmissionsJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(groupings, retain_existing_grading: true)
    groupings.each do |grouping|
      new_submission = grouping.current_submission_used
      old_submission = ...
      new_submission.copy_grading_data(old_submission)
    end
  end
end
```

<!-- end_slide -->
Task 1 Recap
===
### Implication
```ruby
class SubmissionsJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(groupings, retain_existing_grading: true)
    groupings.each do |grouping|
      new_submission = grouping.current_submission_used
      old_submission = ...
      new_submission.copy_grading_data(old_submission)
    end
  end
end
```
<!-- pause -->

## Error Handling Strategy
<!-- pause -->
- Before, I was just adding warning messages to a flash messages using the
  `add_warning_messages` helper that already existed in the `SubmissionsJob`
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Not a bad idea, but had many ugly early-return cases
<!-- end_slide -->
Task 1 Recap
===
### Ugly Early Return

```ruby +line_numbers {1-17|7-11}
class SubmissionsJob < ApplicationJob
  def add_warning_message
    ...
  end

  def copy_grading_data(grouping)
    record.update(attribute_name: attribute)
    if record.errors
      add_warning_message(record.errors)
      return
    end
  end

  def perform(groupings, retain_existing_grading: true)
    ...
  end
end
```

<!-- pause -->
- But like 8 of these at various levels of nesting

<!-- end_slide -->
Task 1 Recap
===
### New and Improved
```ruby +line_numbers {1-5|3}
class Submission < ApplicationRecord
  def self.copy_grading_data(old_submission)
    record.update!(attribute: attribute_value)
  end
end
```
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- The above raises an `Exception` upon error, and the calling function
  `SubmissionsJob` automatically handles this and flashes a message
<!-- pause -->
  - **Problem:** Stops the entire `SubmissionsJob` in its tracks, but could be the best behaviour; checking with David
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- At maximum `one if statement` to prevent this from happening (as opposed to 8 repetitive ones)

<!-- end_slide -->
Task 1 Recap
===
# Rewriting the Tests
<!-- pause -->
- Moved all tests from `SubmissionsJob` to `Submission` model
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- A *lot* cleaner; way less loops since I only need to test on `one mock submission`
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Better because it allows me to test the functionality in much more isolation
<!-- pause -->
  - `SubmissionsJob` does a lot of other stuff
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Had to also redo the way I was doing some factories and such, but it was ultimately for the better

<!-- pause -->
# Lessons Learned
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Think before you code

<!-- end_slide -->
Task 2 Recap
===
<!-- pause -->
# The Task
<!-- pause -->
- Add `zoom functionality` to PDF reader
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Looked at some old PRs to try and figure out how the integration of the `pdf.js` library happened and why we didn't include functionality
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Found this gem (no pun intended):

```bash +exec
brave-browser https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus/pull/1860#issuecomment-61412858
```

<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Now I know how *not* to approach this
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Briefly investigated how images do their zoom (`custom zoom`)
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Will get crackalackin on this task this week

<!-- end_slide -->
Next Week
===
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Get PR merged
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Hopefully finish some preliminary implementation of the PDF zoom

<!-- end_slide -->

The End
