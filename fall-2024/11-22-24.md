This Week's Tasks
===
# Task 1

<!--pause-->
- Add an option so instructor can preserve grading data when
  recollecting an already collected submission 
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Do this by `copying over` old grading data

<!-- pause -->
# Task 2
<!-- pause -->
- Incorporate `zoom functionality` for PDF viewer

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===

# Last Week
<!-- pause -->
- Handled failure case on copy using `Rails transactions`

# This Week
<!-- pause -->
- Completed test coverage for failure case
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Manually tested functionality again (specifically positive case)
<!-- pause -->
  - A bit weird because `seed data` has some `faulty annotations`, so it was
    triggering failure cases always
<!-- pause -->
  - Deleted faulty annotations to test positive behaviour
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Requested another review on the PR
<!-- pause -->
  - I think it will be merged this time or only have very minor changes

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 2 Recap
===

# Last Week
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Implemented zoom functionality
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Had some questions about `scaling`
<!-- pause -->

## David's Suggestion
<!-- pause -->
- Instead of using zoom-in and zoom-out `buttons`, just make a `dropdown` where
  you can select the zoom instead
<!-- pause -->
  - Pretty common practice in PDF viewing, and eliminates any scale math you
    have to do because user is in control
<!-- pause -->
# This Week
<!-- pause -->
- Spent a great deal of time trying to make my `toolbar not scroll`
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
- Adapted my changes to use the dropdown instead (only for zoom, rotate was the same)
<!-- pause -->
  - Existing `SingleSelectDropDown` component made this somewhat easy
<!-- pause -->
  - Still had to change to accept `custom style overrides` while preserving
    behaviour in existing places
<!-- pause -->

## Demo: Zoom/Rotate Functionality and Custom Style Overrides
<!-- pause -->

```bash +exec
brave-browser http://172.17.0.1:3000/csc108/courses/1/results/934/edit
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 2 Recap
===
# This Week Contd.

<!-- pause -->
## Writing Tests

<!-- pause -->
- Hard to write tests for zooming and rotating
<!-- pause -->
  - How would you know it `actually zooms`?

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

- **Solution:** since we're using an external library: 
    1. `Assume` the library works properly
    2. `Mock` the library's objects and feed them to our code
    3. Ensure our code `modifies` the library objects correctly

<!-- pause -->
### Demo: Front-end testing with an external library dependency

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 2 Recap and Next Steps
===
# Next Steps

<!-- pause -->
- PR review/merge
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- New task

<!-- pause -->
# New Task 
<!-- pause -->
- Issue 7296 (only 3 weeks old!): `rubric criterion` isn't populated correctly with a `denominator greater than 4`
<!-- pause -->
  - For example, max mark 8 should have marks `0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0`, but it's just `0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0`
<!-- pause -->

## Demo: Unable to Reproduce :(
<!-- pause -->
```bash +exec
brave-browser http://172.17.0.1:3000/csc108/courses/1/assignments/6/criteria
```

<!-- pause -->
## Next Steps
<!-- pause -->
- Reproduce the issue
<!-- pause -->
- Fix it? According to David, should be pretty quick (after I manage to reproduce it)
<!-- end_slide -->
<!-- reset_layout -->
<!-- jump_to_middle -->
The End
