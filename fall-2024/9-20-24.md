The Task
===

<!-- pause -->
- **Issue `#7070`**: when a `test group is deleted` on an assignment's
  autotester settings, it's `still in the summary JSON/CSV file`
  that you can download
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
  - Issue requirement:

```
In other words, the only tests that should show 
up are the ones that show up in the test results 
tab of the most recently run test.
```
<!-- end_slide -->
Recap: Last Week
===

<!--pause-->
- User `runs tests`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- User `deletes a test`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- User `runs tests again`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- Autotester tells MarkUs `which tests it ran`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- MarkUs marks the non-run tests as `deleted`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- The next time the user tries to `download test results`, only `non-deleted`
  tests are added to the file

The Wise Words of David

David:

```
Hi Pranav, I think I have good news and bad news. 
The good news is your presentation was... clear... 
I guess that bad news is I think you've overcomplicated 
things.
```

Pranav:

```
lol whoopsies :)

Pranav:


```
Hi David, thanks for the feedback! ... this sounds 
like a great approach...!
```
<!-- end_slide -->

David's Proposed Approach
===

<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- After the autotester comes back, we already have the `test_runs` stored in the 
  database
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- We can modify the query to simply look at the latest `test_run` when
  downloading autotest results

<!--pause-->
# The Error of My Ways
<!--pause-->

- Assumption: this is a 2-step process
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- Assumption: any situation where I modify the SQL query
  by more than one line is inefficient

<!-- end_slide -->

The New Process
===
# Step 1: The Original Query
<!--pause-->
```ruby {1-23|1-8|10-23|11|12-15|16-23}
    test_groups_query = self.test_groups
                            .joins(test_group_results: { test_run: :grouping })
                            .group('test_groups.id', 'groupings.id')
                            .select('test_groups.id AS test_groups_id',
                                    'MAX(test_group_results.created_at) \ 
                                    AS test_group_results_created_at')
                            .where.not('test_runs.submission_id': nil)
                            .to_sql

    self.test_groups
        .joins(test_group_results: [:test_results, { test_run: { grouping: :group } }])
        .joins("INNER JOIN (#{test_groups_query}) sub \
                ON test_groups.id = sub.test_groups_id
                AND test_group_results_test_groups.created_at \ 
                = sub.test_group_results_created_at")
        .select('test_groups.name',
                'test_groups_id',
                'groups.group_name',
                'test_results.name as test_result_name',
                'test_results.status',
                'test_results.marks_earned',
                'test_results.marks_total',
                :output, :extra_info, :error_type)
```
<!-- end_slide -->

The New Process
===
# Step 2: Identify the Problem

```sql {1-17|3|8-9}
select
    test_groups.id as test_groups_id,
    MAX(test_group_results.created_at) as test_group_results_created_at
from
    "test_groups"
inner join "test_group_results" on
    "test_group_results"."test_group_id" = "test_groups"."id"
inner join "test_runs" on
    "test_runs"."id" = "test_group_results"."test_run_id"
inner join "groupings" on
    "groupings"."id" = "test_runs"."grouping_id"
where
    "test_groups"."assessment_id" = 15
    and "test_runs"."submission_id" is not null
group by
    "test_groups"."id",
    "groupings"."id"
```
<!-- end_slide -->

The New Processes
===
# Step 3: Fix It

## Part 1: Getting the timestamps of the latest test runs per grouping

```sql
select MAX(created_at) as test_runs_created_at, grouping_id
    from
        test_runs
    group by
        grouping_id
```
<!-- end_slide -->

The New Processes
===
# Step 3: Fix It

## Part 2: Getting the actual test runs by timestamp and grouping ID

```sql {1-15|6-13}
select
    tr2.id,
from
    test_runs tr2
inner join (
    select
        MAX(created_at) as test_runs_created_at,
        grouping_id
    from
        test_runs
    group by
        grouping_id
    ) ltrg on
    ltrg.grouping_id = tr2.grouping_id
    and ltrg.test_runs_created_at = tr2.created_at
```
<!-- end_slide -->

The New Processes
===
# Step 3: Fix It

## Part 3: Putting it in the actual query

This was way too long to put on here, so this is a cue to go to the SQL editor.

<!-- end_slide -->

<!-- jump_to_middle -->
Done, right?

<!-- end_slide -->
<!-- jump_to_middle -->
Sike, you thought.

<!-- end_slide -->

The Great Rewriting
===
# Step 1: Find the Bare Minimum Tables to Join
<!--pause-->

```sql {1-15|13}
select
  tg.name,
  tg.id,
  g2.group_name,
  tr.name as test_result_name,
  tr.status,
  tr.marks_earned,
  tr.marks_total
from
  test_results tr
inner join test_group_results tgr on tr.test_group_result_id = tgr.id
inner join test_groups tg on tgr.test_group_id = tg.id
inner join test_runs tr on tgr.test_run_id = tr.id
inner join groupings g on tr.grouping_id = g.id
inner join groups g2 on g.group_id = g2.id
```
<!-- end_slide -->

The Great Rewriting
===
# Step 2: Replace the test runs with only the latest test runs

<!--pause-->
Also make more improvements suggested by David. 
<!--pause-->
Also too long to put on this slide.

<!--pause-->
Cut to SQL editor.
<!--pause-->

## Code Demo: Rails Translation

<!--new_line-->
<!--pause-->
## At Long Last
<!--pause-->
- Wrote tests (turned out to be easier than expected because the tests were
  already set up, just had to change some numbers and add one new case)
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- Eventually the PR was merged in
<!-- end_slide -->

Upcoming Week: New Task
===

# The Issue
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- Before marking/remarking a submission, the instructor must `collect`
  it
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- When a instructor has to remark, they have to `recollect` a submission 
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- In the process of recollecting, they `lose all grading data` from the old submission 
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- **Issue 5212:** `do not overwrite` existing fields on recollection 

<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
# The Task
<!-- pause -->
- Create a `new option` on the UI when collecting submissions to `retain grading data`
<!-- pause -->
  - This will be a `copy operation` of old grading data to new `Submission` and
    `Result` objects created upon recollection
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- First will implement it for `one submission at a time`, then allow for doing this `in bulk`
