This Week's Tasks
===
# Task 1

<!--pause-->
- Add an option so instructor can preserve grading data when
  recollecting an already collected submission 
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Do this by `copying over` old grading data

<!-- pause -->
# Task 2
<!-- pause -->
- Incorporate `zoom functionality` for PDF viewer

<!-- end_slide -->

Recaps
===
<!-- pause -->
# Task 1
<!-- pause -->
- More minor changes for code clarity, consistency, and ease of use
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Better error handling 

<!-- pause -->
# Task 2
<!-- pause -->

- Implemented zoom functionality

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===
# When Things Go Wrong: Handling Errors
<!-- pause -->
Upon hitting the `collect button`, the following occurs:
<!-- pause -->
1. New `submission` object is created (new `result` is automatically created)
    - Submission is marked as the `used submission`
<!-- pause -->
2. Attempt to copy data from old submission/result to new submission/result
    - If this `fails`, simply catch the error and add warning message to the flash message
<!-- pause -->

## The Problem
<!-- pause -->
- We abandon the `new submission` halfway through in the failure case
<!-- pause -->
- User sees an incomplete submission 
<!-- pause -->
  - Neither clean nor containing all data from the old one
<!-- pause -->
  - Seems like they lost their data
<!-- pause -->
- Data is not actually lost, it's just in the `old submission`, which we never
  deleted
<!-- pause -->
- **Solution:** upon failure, `delete the half-baked new submission` and make the old one the
  active one again

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===
# When Things Go Wrong: Handling Errors

## How to Handle Delete
<!-- pause -->
### My Solution
<!-- pause -->
- Upon failure, manually delete the new submission and mark the
  old one as the active one in addition to flashing warning message
<!-- pause -->
```ruby +line_numbers {1-7|2|4|5|6}
begin
    new_submission.copy_grading_data(old_submission)
rescue Error
   add_warning_messages(...)
   new_submission.destroy!
   old_submission.update(used: true)
end
```
<!-- end_slide -->

# When Things Go Wrong: Handling Errors

## How to Handle Delete
<!-- pause -->
### David's (Better) Solution
<!-- pause -->
- Guard region with Rails `transaction`
<!-- pause -->
```ruby +line_numbers 
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
    # may raise exception
    new_submission.copy_grading_data(old_submission)
end
```
<!-- pause -->
- Automatically `rolls back` any changes made to the DB in that block if an
  exception is raised within it
<!-- pause -->
- Still want my warning message though

<!-- end_slide -->
Task 1 Recap
===
# When Things Go Wrong: Handling Errors
### Final Solution
<!-- pause -->
- Guard region with Rails `transaction`
<!-- pause -->
```ruby +line_numbers {1-9|4|6|7}
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
    begin
        # may raise exception
        new_submission.copy_grading_data(old_submission)
    rescue Exception => e
        add_warning_message(e)
        raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
    end
end
```
<!-- pause -->
- Do additional error handling and `manually raise` the rollback call

<!-- end_slide -->
Task 2 Recap
===
<!-- pause -->
# Zoom 
<!-- pause -->
- Looked into `pdf.js` library to figure out how I can scale stuff
<!-- pause -->
- Implemented rotation and zoom

<!-- pause -->
## The Scaling Problem

<!-- pause -->
### Problem 1: Relative Scaling
<!-- pause -->
- Our default zoom for all PDFs was the "constant" `page-width`
<!-- pause -->
  - Not a real number; it's calculated, and it's different depending on your
    screen size
<!-- pause -->
  - E.g. the initial scale could be `0.83243`, weird number to start at since
    the user can see this on the UI
<!-- pause -->
- When they hit the zoom in/zoom out button, what should we even scale to?
<!-- pause -->
- Possible solution 1: Lie and say `page-width` is `1.0` scaling
<!-- pause -->
  - Hmm
<!-- pause -->
- Possible solution 2: Actually start from `1` scale no matter what, let the user zoom
<!-- pause -->
  - Could be a pain in the butt on bigger screens

<!-- end_slide -->
Task 2 Recap
===
# Zoom 
## The Scaling Problem
### Problem 2: Scale Factor
<!-- pause -->
- How do we `scale` stuff numbers-wise?
<!-- pause -->
- **Approach 1:** relatively scale by 10% each time
<!-- pause -->
  - Drawback: non-linear (100%, 110%, 121%, 133.1%, etc.)
<!-- pause -->
- **Approach 2:** scale absolutely by 10%
<!-- pause -->
  - Much better: linear (100%, 110%, 120%)

<!-- pause -->
### Problem 3: The UI
<!-- pause -->
#### Demo: Zooming, Rotating, and the UI
<!-- pause -->
```bash +exec
brave-browser http://172.17.0.1:3000/csc108/courses/1/results/1/edit
```

<!-- end_slide -->
Looking Forward
===
<!-- pause -->
# Next Week
<!-- pause -->
- Get `Task 1 PR merged` (I think it will actually happen this time, I
  just have to retest some stuff)
<!-- pause -->
- Finalize zoom functionality, figure out how to `write tests` for this, and `PR`

<!-- pause -->
# Looking for Suggestions
  - The `UI`
  - What should the `default page width` be like 
  - How the `scaling` should work (linear vs non-linear)
