This Week's Tasks
===
# Task 1

<!--pause-->
- Add an option so instructor can preserve grading data when
  recollecting an already collected submission 
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Do this by `copying over` old grading data

<!-- pause -->
# Task 2
<!-- pause -->
- Incorporate `zoom functionality` for PDF viewer

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===
# Last Week
<!-- pause -->
- Refactored code that copied data from one submission to another to the `Submission` model

<!-- pause -->
# This Week

<!-- pause -->
## Basic PR Feedback
<!-- pause -->
- Refactored some things for code style, consistency, etc.

<!-- pause -->
## Copying Remark Information (Change in Requirements)
<!-- pause -->
- **Background:** any submission that has a remark requested has `two results`; one original one and one for the remark
<!-- pause -->
- **Before:** only copy the data from the `original result` to the default result created on the new submission
<!-- pause -->
- **After:** copy over data from both `original result` and `remark result` to the new submission

<!-- end_slide -->

Task 1 Recap
===
## Further Refactoring
<!-- pause -->
- Needed to copy data from results twice, but that logic was embedded in the `Submission` copy function
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Refactored code that copied data from *results* out from the newly refactored `Submission` code into the `Result` model

<!-- pause -->
## Writing Tests
<!-- pause -->
- Rewrote the tests for this again
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- **Plus point:** tests are now extremely modular, each suite tests exactly one functionality
<!-- pause -->
  - Good practice when it comes to `unit testing`

<!-- end_slide -->
Task 2 Recap
=== 
<!-- pause -->
# The Task

<!-- pause -->
- Implement `zoom functionality` for PDF viewer on MarkUs

<!-- pause -->
# What I Did

<!-- pause -->
- Investigate `pdf.js` a bit further and tried to understand how we did zoom for `images`
<!-- pause -->

## Demo: Image Zoom
```bash +exec
brave-browser http://172.17.0.1:3000/csc108/courses/1/results/1/edit#
```
<!-- pause -->
## Demo: Custom Zoom Logic

<!-- pause -->
- Didn't want to do this
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Did some googling and asked ChatGPT on how we can scale a PDF in pdf.js, found `currentScale` attribute
  - On a whim, searched for this in the PDF viewer file

<!-- pause -->
## Demo: Adjusting Scale

<!-- end_slide -->
Next Week
=== 

# Task 1

<!-- pause -->
- Get PR merged (sigh)

<!-- pause -->
# Task 2
<!-- pause -->
- Yoink `zoom toolbar UI` from the image viewer for consistency and also so I don't have to write a toolbar
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Make the buttons adjust this scale and hope to god I don't run into the reason we didn't do this the first time
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Testing and PR
<!-- pause -->
  - Should be easy because I should just need to keep track of a state
<!-- pause -->
  - (Famous last words)
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- gg

<!-- end_slide -->
<!-- reset_layout -->
<!-- jump_to_middle -->
