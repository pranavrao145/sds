The Task
===

- **Issue `#7070`**: when a `test group is deleted` on an assignment's
  autotester settings, it's `still in the summary JSON/CSV file`
  that you can download
<!-- new_line -->
<!-- pause -->
  - Issue requirement:

```
In other words, the only tests that should show up are the ones
that show up in the test results tab of the most recently run
test.
```
<!-- pause -->
# Demo
```bash +exec
firefox http://172.17.0.1:3000/csc108/courses/1/assignments/13/automated_tests/manage
```
<!-- end_slide -->

Investigation
===

- Investigated `"Download Test Results" button` to figure out
  how it was getting which tests to add to the downloaded file
<!-- pause -->
  - Recovered `SQL query from Rails logs` and ran manually (demo)
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Investigated `delete button` on autotesting management page to figure out
  what it was actually doing
<!-- pause -->
  - Found `update_test_groups_from_specs` function
<!-- pause -->
  - Handled `add` and `update` cases, but no explcit `delete` case
```ruby 
if test_group_id.nil?
  # add a new test group
else
  # modify the list of test groups for an assignment, omitting ones that were deleted
end

```
<!-- pause -->
  - It employed a `soft delete` methodology for old test groups
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
  - **Solution:** Maintain soft delete, but `modify SQL query` to be able to easily figure out
   which test groups it should not return
<!-- end_slide -->

Solution
===
<!--pause-->
# High-Level Solution
<!--pause-->
- Create a new boolean column in the `test_group` table to `explicitly mark` if a field is deleted
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- Modify the `SQL query` used by the `summary JSON/CSV endpoint` to filter for only `non-deleted` test groups

<!--pause-->
# Key Challenge: How to Mark as Deleted?

<!--pause-->
Two possible ways:
<!--pause-->
- Add a `delete` case to the `update_test_groups_from_specs` function (mark as
  deleted when you actually delete the test group)
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- Mark as deleted when you `run the tests`

<!-- end_slide -->

Actual Solution
===
# Challenge: How to figure out which test are deleted on runtime?
<!--pause-->
- Autotest settings are `stored in JSON`, and require parsing
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- We `never access autotester settings` when running tests
<!--pause-->
  - The autotester already has them
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- We don't know which test groups the autotester just ran
<!--pause-->
  - The autotester does not tell us
<!--pause-->
  - **Solution:** modify the autotester to tell us

<!--pause-->
```python
...
     for settings_ in test_settings["testers"]:
         for data in settings_["test_data"]:
             timeout += data["timeout"]
 
     ids = []
     for data in test_data:
def run_tests(settings_id, user):
   ...
   return {"test_ids": ids}

+    return {"test_ids": ids, "test_group_ids": list(test_group_ids)}

Final Overview
===
<!--pause-->
- User `runs tests`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- User `deletes a test`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- User `runs tests again`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- Autotester tells MarkUs `which tests it ran`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- MarkUs marks the non-run tests as `deleted`
<!--pause-->
<!--new_line-->
- The next time the user tries to `download test results`, only `non-deleted`
  tests are added to the file

<!-- end_slide -->
