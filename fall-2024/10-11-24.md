This Week's Task
===

# The Issue
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- Before marking/remarking a submission, the instructor must `collect`
  it
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- In some cases, the instructor has to `recollect` a submission that's already been collected
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- In the process of recollecting, they `lose all grading data` from the old submission
<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
- **Issue 5212:** option to `not overwrite existing fields` on recollection 

<!-- pause -->
<!--new_line-->
# The Task
<!-- pause -->
- Create a `new option` on the UI when recollecting submissions to `retain grading data`
<!-- pause -->
  - This will be a `copy operation` of old grading data to new `Submission` and
    `Result` objects created upon recollection
<!-- end_slide -->

What I Did This Week
===

# Recap
<!-- pause -->
- Write tests. Lots of them.
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Manual sanity-check testing.

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Discovered three new problems
<!-- pause -->
  - Weird validation error when copying over objects
<!-- pause -->
  - Annotations not showing up on the results page (demo)
<!-- pause -->
  - Feedback files pane not showing up (demo)

<!-- pause -->
# Demo: Problems
```bash +exec
brave-browser http://172.17.0.1:3000/csc108/courses/1/results/1/edit
```
<!-- end_slide -->

Fixing It
===

# Problem 2: Feedback files pane not showing up

<!-- pause -->
- I straight up forgot to copy the feedback files over whoopsies. 

```ruby {7}
class Submission < ApplicationRecord
...
  has_many :submission_files, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :annotations, through: :submission_files
  has_many :test_runs ...
  has_many :test_group_results, through: :test_runs
  has_many :feedback_files, dependent: :destroy
...
end
```

<!-- end_slide -->

Fixing It
===

# Problem 1: Annotations not showing up on the results page
<!-- pause -->
- I was copying over `Annotation` objects, but annotations are associated with
  `submission files` (obviously)
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Each new `Submission` creates new `submission files`
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- I needed to change the `submission_file_id` to correspond with the submission
  files on the new submission rather than the old one.

Done right?
<!-- end_slide -->
<!-- jump_to_middle -->

Wrong. It's never that simple.

Aside: Factories
===
# An Example

```ruby {1-13|1|2|3-10}
factory :assignment_with_criteria_and_results, parent: :assignment do
  after(:create) do |a|
    create_list(:flexible_criterion, 3, assignment: a)
    create_list(:grouping_with_inviter_and_submission, 3, assignment: a)
    a.groupings.each do |grouping|
      result = grouping.current_result
      result.marks.each do |mark|
        mark.update(mark: rand(mark.criterion.max_mark + 1))
      end
      result.update(marking_state: Result::MARKING_STATES[:complete])
    end
  end
end
```
<!-- end_slide -->
Aside: Factories
===
# Usage
```ruby
let(:assignment) { create(:assignment_with_criteria_and_results) }
```
<!-- pause -->
# Problem With Factories
<!-- pause -->
- They lie.
<!-- end_slide -->

Back to Main Quest: Testing New Behaviour
===
<!-- pause -->
# What I Had To Test
<!-- pause -->
- Changing the `copied annotations` to point to the submission files of the `new
  submission` rather than the old one

# The Problem
<!-- pause -->
- `SubmissionsJob` goes grouping by grouping from an array of groupings
  and collects files from their `repositories` to make new submissions
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Since factories fake everything (including `submission files`) there
  were no files in the fake groupings' `repositories`
  - Submission files were manually populated for each old submission
<!-- end_slide -->
Back to Main Quest: Testing New Behaviour
===
# The Problem: Continued
- Consequence: when `SubmissionsJob` created a new submission for each `grouping`, new submissions had no files
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Can't make new annotations point to submission files that `don't exist`
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- This didn't matter up until now because I was blindly copying annotations
  without associating them to `submission files`
<!-- pause -->
# Possible Solutions

<!-- pause -->
- **Solution 1:** mock everything manually
<!-- pause -->
  - Factories and manual creation of objects don't play nice together
<!-- pause -->
  - A huge pain in the butt

<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->

- **Solution 2:** create a new elaborate factory where files are actually in a grouping's repo rather than fully mocked
<!-- pause -->
  - Don't even know if this is possible
<!-- pause -->
  - Thought of this in the shower this morning, needs PoC

<!-- end_slide -->
A Cool Thing I Learned
===

<!-- pause -->
# Running Rails Console in Test Environment

<!-- pause -->
```bash
bundle exec rails c -e test --sandbox
```

<!-- pause -->
In Rails console:

<!-- pause -->
```ruby
require 'factory_bot'
include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods

create(:assignment_with_criteria_and_results)
```
<!-- end_slide -->
Next Steps
===
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Figure out what to do about the aforementioned situation
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Write frontend tests
<!-- pause -->
<!-- new_line -->
- Make PR this time and (hopefully) put this task to bed
<!-- end_slide -->
<!-- reset_layout -->

The End
